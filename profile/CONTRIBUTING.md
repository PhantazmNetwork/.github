# Phantazm Contribution Guidelines

Welcome to the Contribution Guidelines document! If you're reading this, it probably means you're thinking about making a contribution to Phantazm. We appreciate it! ðŸ’™

### New contributor guide

If you're unfamiliar with the project, please read the appropriate README first, and consider joining our Discord. We'd be happy to answer your questions!

### Issues

Issues are either for suggestions or bug reports. When making suggestions, clearly describe what your ideas are and give as much information as necessary. When making bug reports, give as much information as possible and include the steps to reproduce the bug. 


### Pull requests

If you wrote some code that fixes a bug, feel free to make a pull request for it. Your code should conform to our general style. A maintainer will review it, potentially suggest changes, and eventually merge.

If you want to add a new feature, you should get feedback from the team first before making your pull request.
