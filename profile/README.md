# PhantazmNetwork

Phantazm is a Minecraft server network dedicated to making complex, PvE based minigames. We're powered by [Minestom](https://github.com/Minestom/Minestom]), a fantastic free, open-source implementation of the Minecraft server protocol. 

Our code is open-source, GPL-licensed, and can be found right here on GitHub. Contributions are welcome!
